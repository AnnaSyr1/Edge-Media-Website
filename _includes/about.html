        <p class="text-faded">HTuO Biosciences is on a mission: we want to make the process of designing drugs faster and more efficient, and to make it possible to target proteins that are currently outside the scope of traditional drug design - all while making it cheaper to bring those drugs to market. We believe that the best way to improve our understanding of molecular interactions is to create more accurate models, both of the molecules of interest as well as the solvent in which they're interacting.  
<br><br>
By using high-accuracy atomic models, we can better predict how molecules will behave, and therefore better predict how drugs interact with their intended targets.  
<br><br>
Where other companies are building tools that allow them to screen more molecules in less time, we're building tools that will help us better identify those molecules, so we can spend less time searching, and more time working to help patients.</p>

“Out of 66 clinical candidates, published by the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in the 2016–2017 period, none originated as a virtual screening hit. It is a fact that predicting binding affinities is terribly difficult, and one of the main compounding factors is the solvent’s effect.”</p>
