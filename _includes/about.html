                <p class="text-faded">`Behind the Research` is an initiative lead by Kat Phillips and supported by SAMBa and Public Engagement Unit 
                    at the University of Bath. It is a collaboration of PhD students showcasing the real-life, 
                    day to day aspects of research at all stages, and uses a variety of platforms and mediums to (hopefully) de-mystify academia. <br>
                    Though there is a focus on delivering interesting and entertaining content, this scheme also focuses on providing training and outreach opportunities to the PhD students in the maths deparment at the University of Bath. Through content creation, we aim to support PhD students in developing their own skills.  </p>
