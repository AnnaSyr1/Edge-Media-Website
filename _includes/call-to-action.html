                    The Quantum Resistant Ledger tipbot was created to enable sending tips to users of our community. 
                    The tipbot was created, and is supported by members of the QRL Contributors group both in time and emotional support, <i>it's not always easy being a bot...</i> Consider it a thanks from the community, to the community.
