                <p class="text-faded">The motivation for our project is stylish clothing and a cool way to include technology in your life. The vision is to have helpful tech that is just there and hopefully not inconvenient in any way. Clothing is always there and is already convenient. So how can we add tech that might be wanted all the time?</p>
