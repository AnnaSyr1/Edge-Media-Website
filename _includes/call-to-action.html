                    The Quantum Resistant Ledger tipbot was created to enable sending tips to users of our community. 
                    The tipbot is a labor of love created, and supported by members of the QRL Community in time and emotional support. <i>it's not always easy being a bot...</i> Consider it a thanks from the community, to the community.
