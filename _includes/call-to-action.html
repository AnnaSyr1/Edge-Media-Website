                <h3>About The Project</h3>
                <p class="text-dark text-left">
                    The Quantum Resistant Ledger tipbot was created to enable sending tips to users of our community. 
                    The tipbot is a labor of love created, and supported by members of the QRL Community in time and emotional support. <i>it's not always easy being a bot...</i> Consider it a thanks from the community, to the community.
                </p>
                <p class="text-dark text-left">
                    We believe in the power of an open, free, and decentralized future and we understand that secure systems build the path there. <a class="a-dark" href="https://theqrl.org" target="_blank"> The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> is doing exactly that with <a class="a-dark" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8391/" target="_blank"> NIST approved, quantum resistant cryptography</a> securing the signature scheme and <a class="a-dark" href="https://github.com/theQRL/audits" target="_blank"> two independent security audits by reputable firms</a>. This project means security when they say it!</p>
                <p class="text-dark text-left">
                    All tips are sent on-chain to users individual tipbot wallet addresses. Users can sign-up through the Discord channel and once setup, can start sending and receiving tips through the tipbot.

                    In order to collect some free quanta through the faucet you will need an active account with the bot. Faucet payout timing, and payout amounts may change at any time at the bot owners discretion. Remember this is provided as a courtesy to the community, please don't abuse it!
