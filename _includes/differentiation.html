                    the molecule the charges are automatically calculated.
                    Our force field adapts to its surroundings as it does in nature.

                <p style="font-size:clamp(16px, 1.5vmax, 24px);">By correctly simulating the breaking of bonds the <strong> HTuO technology generates a reactive force field</strong>
                    that has the potential to replicate pH at the binding sites. This is important when modeling water
                    molecules and movement of protons at the binding site.

                <p style="font-size:clamp(16px, 1.5vmax, 24px);"><strong>HTuOâ€™s system inherently captures emergent properties</strong> such as hydrophobicity which allows for more
                    accurate calculation of drug solubility.
