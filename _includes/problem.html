                <H4>IDENTIFYING OPTIMAL DRUG CANDIDATES
                </H4>
                <p>Drug development is time consuming, resource intensive and fails 90% of the time.
                </p>

                <p>A more predictive lead optimization process can lower the failure rate by improving effectiveness,
                    lowering toxicity and increasing the absorption of drugs.
                </p>
                <p>HTuOâ€™s proprietary physics-based molecular modeling solution with a novel force field allows for a
                    very accurate study of drug interactions.
                </p>
                <p>HTuO will reduce the time and resources required to develop drugs by improving the lead optimization
                    process.
