# Edge Media Agency Website

🌐 This project involves the development of a GitHub Page that serves as a showcase for a marketing agency's online presence. We created this GitHub Page in order to practice one of the Data Analytics Bootcamp Courses and designed to be used in conjunction with the [Marketing Campaign Effectiveness Report](https://github.com/AnnaSyr1/Marketing-Campaign-Effectiveness-Report?tab=readme-ov-file). The goal is to demonstrate how data analytics can be integrated into marketing strategies to enhance business outcomes.
